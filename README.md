# Integrating Real-Time Air Quality and Public Transport Data

## Overview
This documentation provides step-by-step instructions for implementing a solution that integrates real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data with public transportation routes and schedules. This solution is aimed at enhancing urban living by providing residents with actionable insights into air quality and efficient journey planning.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `requests`, `pandas`
- API access to real-time AQI and public transportation data

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Required Libraries**
   Ensure you have Python installed and then install the necessary libraries:
   bash
   pip install requests pandas
   

2. **API Configuration**
   - Obtain API access keys if required and replace the `aqi_api_url` and `transport_api_url` with the actual endpoints.

3. **Understanding the Code**
   - `get_aqi_data()`: Fetches AQI data from the API and returns a DataFrame.
   - `get_transport_data()`: Fetches public transport data from the API and returns a DataFrame.
   - `integrate_data()`: Merges the two datasets based on the location to provide a combined view.

4. **Running the Script**
   - Execute the script using Python:
   bash
   python integrate_data.py
   
   - The script will output the first few rows of the integrated dataset, showing air quality and transport information side-by-side.

## Usage
- This integrated dataset can be used to develop applications or dashboards that provide real-time insights into air quality and transport routes, aiding in better decision-making for residents and planners.
